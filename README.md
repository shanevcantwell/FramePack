# **goan: A Power-User UI for FramePack**

[!IMPORTANT]
An absolute must-read before even touching `goan` is the official FramePack documentation, as it contains  beautiful examples that FramePack is capable of from just the most basic controls exposed in the engine's repo: lllyasviel/FramePack

Introducing goan, an enhanced user interface designed for creative professionals and power users of FramePack. This project builds upon the brilliant FramePack video generation engine created by lllyasviel (of Fooocus and the Stable Diffusion Forge fork of A1111), exposing useful controls to reach further into FramePack's functionality through a robust and intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Core Principles & Advanced Features

`goan` is built on principles that empower your creative workflow and hide complexity until you're ready for it:

*   **Never Re-Generate**: Your time is valuable. `goan` is designed to minimize wasted computation. Features like **task checkpointing and resumption** (currently the highest priority project) will allow you to pick up exactly where you left off, even after a crash or intentional pause.
*   **Robust Session Management**: Your long-running jobs are safe. The entire task queue and UI state are persistently managed, ensuring resilience against browser disconnects or application restarts. Because nothing spoils a 4hr run like all your controls popping up [Error] boxes halfway through with no way to fully recover them.
*   **Intuitive & Unthreatening UI**: Powerful features shouldn't require a manual. `goan` aims to hide the settings requiring more experience until you're ready to explore it, making it easy to pick up and use without extensive documentation.
*   **Effortless "Recipe" Management**: Experiment freely without losing track of your settings.
    *   **Drop-in Metadata**: Simply drag and drop any PNG generated by `goan` into the UI, and it will automatically detect and offer to apply all of the actual "creative" UI control settings used to generate the video matchi.
    *   **"Stamp" Your Work**: Download a copy of your selected I2V image with the current UI settings embedded as metadata.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide (Your First Generation)

This guide will walk you through your first video generation with `goan`. For installation instructions, please see the Installation section below.

### 1. The UI at a Glance

The interface is organized into a few key areas to streamline your workflow. [images coming soon]

*   **Left Panel:** This is your starting point. Drop your input image here, add it to the queue, and start or stop the generation process.
*   **Right Panel:** This is where you get creative. Write your `Prompt` and `Negative Prompt`, and adjust core settings like `Video Length` and `Seed`.
*   **Bottom Area:** This section contains the `Task Queue` where you can see all your pending and completed jobs, and the `Live Preview & Output` where you'll see your video come to life.

### 2. Your First Generation

Let's create a video in four simple steps.

**Step 1: Add an Input Image**
Drag and drop a starting image into the green box upper left. A thumbnail will replace the green field and the buttons make it clear what you're able to do at any given combination of internal states. 

*[Image: A screenshot showing an image being dropped into the file input area, and the resulting preview.]*

**Step 2: Write a Prompt**
In the "Prompt" text box on the right, describe the video you want to create. For example: "A majestic dragon flying over a futuristic city at sunset, cinematic, highly detailed."

**Step 3: Add to Queue**
Click the **"Add to Queue"** button. You'll see your task appear in the `Task Queue` at the bottom.

*[Image: A screenshot of the Task Queue showing one pending task.]*

**Step 4: Process the Queue**
Click the green **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Process Queue"** button. The task status will change to "Processing", and you'll see a live preview of the generation on the right. This button will change to "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Processing" while a task is running, allowing you to gracefully halt the process.

Once it's done, the final video will appear in the "Live Preview & Output" player. Congratulations, you've made your first video!

### 4. Saving and Reusing Your "Recipe"

`goan` makes it easy to save and reuse your settings, whether you prefer visual cues or structured data.

*   **Saving:** After a generation, click the **"Download Image"** button. This saves the input image as a PNG file that contains all of your prompt and slider settings embedded as metadata.
*   **Reusing:** Simply drag and drop that saved PNG back into `goan`. A dialog will pop up asking if you want to apply the settings from that image. This is a powerful way to save, share, and iterate on your creative ideas.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Quick Start

`goan` has a fully scripted installation process, making setup straightforward.

### 1. Run the Installer

Navigate to the root of the `goan` repository in your terminal and run the appropriate script:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
./install.sh <cuda_version>
# Example: ./install.sh 128
# [Note: the 'executable' bit on install.sh keeps getting switched off, so you may need to instead 'source ./install.sh']

# For Windows (in Command Prompt or PowerShell)
.\install.bat <cuda_version>
# Example: .\install.bat 128
```

Replace `<cuda_version>` with your specific CUDA version (e.g., `126` for CUDA 12.6, `128` for CUDA 12.8). The installer will download and set up a complete virtual environment with all necessary dependencies.

### 2. Launch `goan`

Once the installation is complete, you can launch the application using the generated launcher scripts in the root directory:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
./run_goan.sh

# For Windows (in Command Prompt or PowerShell)
.\run_goan.bat

# Run either with '-h' for a complete list of command line arguments such as --server and --port
```

The UI will open automatically in your web browser.

## üôè Acknowledgements

*   **@lllyasviel** for creating the groundbreaking FramePack engine.
*   **@Tophness** for the super-useful queueing system architecture introduced in FramePack PR #150, which forms the origins and foundation of `goan`'s task management, background processing, and progress update features.
*   **@freely-boss** for the clever work in supporting "legacy" Turing and earlier (compute rating SM75 and below) devices to generate.
