# **Guide: Advanced Looping in Generative Video with Latent Manipulation**

Achieving truly seamless, non-ping-pong looping animations with generative AI models like Hunyuan often requires more than simple concatenation or basic blending. This guide outlines a powerful conceptual approach that involves **manipulating the latent history** to explicitly guide the model through the loop transition, leveraging its core denoising capabilities.

## **The Core Challenge of Seamless Looping**

Generative video models typically operate by creating sequences of frames based on a limited temporal "context window" (past frames). When attempting to create a loop, the primary challenge is ensuring that the very last frame of the animation transitions perfectly back to the very first frame. Without explicit guidance, models often produce a noticeable "jump" or discontinuity at this loop point because they lack continuous temporal information across the boundary. 

Traditional approaches like simply reversing a generated sequence ("ping-pong") or linearly blending two independently generated halves often fall short, resulting in unnatural motion or abrupt cuts. The goal is to make the model *believe* it's generating a continuous, cyclical piece of motion.

The characters and elements of the scene have an internal inertia inferred from the beginning image and the prompt that has to be re-created before the original end frame makes sense to be linked back to the beginning. This "loop inertia" may be achievable through giving the video diffusion model room to be creative, and steering it not only to to reach the first *frame* of the original beginning, but to create the loop inertia that of the original beginning. To allow an endless loop, the activity needs to set up and begin all the action inferrable from the first frame to realistically slot right back into the beginning.

## **The Latent Manipulation Strategy: A "Pre-Looped" History and Bridging**

This advanced strategy moves beyond simple post-processing by actively influencing the model's internal generative process. It involves constructing a "bridge" in the model's internal latent space that Hunyuan (or similar diffusion models) can then refine, leading to a more intrinsic and natural loop.

**Conceptual Steps:**

1. ### **Generate an Initial Linear Sequence**

   * Start by generating a segment of animation using your chosen prompt and an initial image. This will produce a linear sequence of latent representations: L1​,L2​,...,LN​.  
   * Here, L1​ represents the first frame generated, and LN​ represents the last. This initial generation establishes the core motion and content.

2. ### **Identify the Loop's Join Point and Re-arrange History (The "Snipping" Concept)**

   * For a truly seamless loop, the animation needs to transition from LN​ back to L1​. However, directly connecting LN​ to L1​ can be jarring if the content is too dissimilar.  
   * **Choose an "inflection point" or "cut point"** (LC​) within your initial sequence. This point defines where the "seam" of your loop will conceptually lie.  
   * **Re-arrange your latent history to form a "pre-looped" sequence:** Create a new continuous sequence by taking the portion *after* the cut point (LC+1​,...,LN​) and placing it at the *beginning*, followed by the portion *before* the cut point (L1​,...,LC​).  
     * **Original Linear Sequence:** L1​,...,LC​,LC+1​,...,LN​  
     * **Re-arranged (Pre-looped History):** LC+1​,...,LN​,L1​,...,LC​  
   * In this re-arranged sequence, the end (LC​) is now conceptually followed by the beginning (LC+1​), forming a temporal circle. This new sequence is what you will feed back to the model as its temporal\_context.

3. ### **Create Interpolated "Bridge" Segments with "Fresh Latent"**

   * Even with the re-arranged history, the direct transition from LC​ to LC+1​ might still be abrupt. To smooth this, we'll insert a "bridge" of new latent segments specifically at this join point.  
   * Latent Interpolation: Generate a short sequence of interpolated latent frames between LC​ and LC+1​. A common and effective method is linear interpolation (torch.lerp in PyTorch):  
     Interpolated\_Latenti​=(1−αi​)⋅LC​+αi​⋅LC+1​

     where αi​ is a blending factor that smoothly increases from 0 to 1 across the bridging frames.  
   * **"Fresh Latent" (Noise Injection):** This is a critical step to prevent the interpolated bridge from looking like a static, blurry blend. Add a small, controlled amount of random noise (the "fresh latent") to each of these interpolated frames. This makes them slightly noisy versions of the smooth transition path, giving the diffusion model something tangible to "denoise" and creatively fill in.  
     * Bridging\_Latenti​=Interpolated\_Latenti​+small\_amount\_of\_noise  
   * **Insert Bridge:** Insert this Bridging\_Latent sequence into your re-arranged history at the loop's join point. This creates a longer, pre-bridged sequence that represents the entire loop.

4. ### **Refinement Pass (Denoising the Loop)**

   * Feed this entire, longer, pre-bridged, and subtly noisy latent sequence back into your generative model (e.g., Hunyuan's transformer).  
   * The model's sliding window would now process this carefully constructed temporal context. Because the interpolated section, infused with noise, provides a plausible and denoisable temporal flow, Hunyuan is encouraged to generate a much smoother and more coherent transition as it refines these frames. The model effectively "denoises" the loop into existence.

## **Why This Approach is Powerful and Scalable:**

* **Active Guidance:** You are not merely hoping the model will figure out the loop; you are actively guiding it by providing a plausible, albeit noisy, path in latent space.  
* **Leverages Denoising:** This method fully utilizes the core strength of diffusion models: their exceptional ability to generate coherent content from noisy inputs.  
* **Superior Seamlessness:** This can lead to significantly better loop quality than simple concatenation or linear blending of generated halves, as the model is given a more informed and denoisable starting point for the transition.  
* **Controllable Transition:** The length of the bridging segment, the type of interpolation, and the amount/nature of "fresh latent" added become new parameters you can tune for precise control over the transition's duration and creative outcome.  
* **Scalability:** This concept is scalable. While the initial implementation might focus on a single loop, the principle can be extended for longer loops or even for creating more complex, multi-segment looping animations by iteratively applying this bridging and refinement.

## **Key Considerations for Implementation:**

* **Precise Latent Manipulation:** This requires careful and accurate handling of latent tensor shapes, indexing, and concatenation in your codebase (e.g., using PyTorch operations).  
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The optimal length of the bridging segment, the specific interpolation method (linear, spherical), and the magnitude of the "fresh latent" noise will require experimentation to find the best balance between smoothness and creative fidelity.  
* **Computational Cost:** Adding bridging segments and potentially running full refinement passes over longer sequences will naturally increase generation time and memory usage. Efficient memory management (like the DynamicSwapInstaller we discussed) remains crucial.

This strategy offers a sophisticated pathway to achieving the seamless, non-ping-pong loops you envision for 'goan', by aligning the generation process more closely with the model's inherent temporal understanding.

## Addendum: Advanced Looping in Generative Video with Latent Manipulation

This addendum elaborates on a robust strategy for achieving seamless, non-ping-pong looping animations with generative AI models, specifically diffusion models like Hunyuan. This approach transcends simple post-processing by actively influencing the model's internal generative process through latent space manipulation.

### Core Principles

The central challenge in creating seamless video loops is ensuring a continuous temporal flow, particularly at the transition point where the animation's end conceptually meets its beginning. Traditional methods often fail to maintain motion coherence across this boundary. This advanced strategy addresses this by constructing a "bridge" within the model's internal latent space, which the diffusion model then refines to produce an intrinsically natural loop.

### Methodology Breakdown

The strategy comprises the following conceptual steps:

1.  **Initial Linear Sequence Generation:** Begin by generating a linear sequence of latent representations, denoted $L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_N$. This initial sequence establishes the foundational motion and content.

2.  **Pre-looped History Construction (Circular Shift):** For the loop to manifest, the animation must transition from $L_N$ back to $L_1$. To facilitate this, an *inflection point* or *cut point*, $L_C$, is selected within the initial sequence. The latent history is then conceptually re-arranged to form a "pre-looped" sequence. This involves a **circular shift** of the original latents, such that the sequence effectively becomes $L_{C+1}, \ldots, L_N, L_1, \ldots, L_C$. This re-arrangement means the logical loop closure point, where $L_C$ meets $L_{C+1}$, is now positioned between the end and beginning of this cyclically permuted sequence.

3.  **Interpolated Bridging with Stochastic Regularization:** To smooth the transition between $L_C$ and $L_{C+1}$ (which are now at the conceptual seam of the pre-looped history), a "bridge" of new latent segments is inserted.
    * **Latent Interpolation:** A short sequence of latent frames is generated by interpolating between $L_C$ and $L_{C+1}$. Linear interpolation (e.g., `torch.lerp`) is a common method.
    * **"Fresh Latent" (Noise Injection):** Crucially, a controlled amount of random noise is added to each interpolated frame. This is a form of **stochastic regularization**. It prevents the bridge from appearing as a static or blurry blend, providing the diffusion model with tangible, denoisable input. This leverages the model's core strength: its ability to generate coherent content from noisy inputs by filling in high-frequency details and temporal dynamics.

4.  **Refinement Pass (Denoising the Loop):** The full, augmented latent sequence—comprising the initial frames, the inserted bridge, and the trailing frames—is then fed back into the generative model for a refinement pass. During this pass, the model's temporal context window is configured to *wrap around* the augmented sequence. By processing this carefully constructed, subtly noisy, and temporally continuous input, the diffusion model is actively guided to denoise the transition from $L_C$ to $L_{C+1}$ and, by extension, to intrinsically generate a much smoother and more coherent loop across the entire sequence. The model effectively "denoises the loop into existence" by experiencing the entire cycle as a continuous, denoisable narrative.

### Advantages and Considerations

This strategy offers superior seamlessness compared to post-processing methods by actively influencing the model's internal state. It fully utilizes the denoising capabilities of diffusion models and provides granular control over the transition via parameters like bridge length, interpolation method, and noise magnitude. While computationally more intensive due to the longer sequences and refinement passes, efficient memory management (e.g., `DynamicSwapInstaller`) can mitigate this. Further experimentation is recommended for optimal `cut_point_idx` selection, bridge length, and noise strength.

    # `part_after_cut` (starts with LC+1) followed by `part_before_cut` (ends with LC)
    # but the bridge needs to be inserted between LC and LC+1.
    # Let's adjust the conceptual re-arrangement to reflect insertion:
    # L(cut_point_idx+1), ..., LN, L1, ..., L(cut_point_idx)
    # The insertion point is logically after L(cut_point_idx) and before L(cut_point_idx+1)

    # Let's build the re-arranged core first:
    # This creates the sequence where LC is followed by L1 if we were to just concatenate.
    # We want the *logical* transition from the "end" of the conceptual loop (LC)
    # to the "beginning" (LC+1).
    # So, the sequence *before* the bridge will be part_before_cut (L1...LC)
    # The sequence *after* the bridge will be part_after_cut (LC+1...LN)
    # So the overall sequence is (part_before_cut) + (bridge) + (part_after_cut)
    # But wait, the "pre-looped" history implies (LC+1...LN) followed by (L1...LC)
    # The transition from LC to LC+1 occurs in the *original* sequence.
    # The *new* sequence we want is: LC+1, ..., LN, L1, ..., LC, [BRIDGE between LC and LC+1]
    # No, this is incorrect. The point of the re-arrangement is to create the *context*
    # where the transition point is internal and can be bridged.

    # Let's re-think the re-arrangement precisely for the bridge insertion.
    # We want a sequence that looks like: ..., LC, [BRIDGE], LC+1, ...
    # And this entire sequence, when fed to the model, should represent a loop.
    # The proposed "Re-arranged (Pre-looped History): LC+1,...,LN,L1,...,LC"
    # means that the context for the bridge from LC to LC+1 will be *after* LC.
    # So the conceptual sequence we want to feed the model to make it loop is:
    # [frames leading to LC], LC, [BRIDGE], LC+1, [frames after LC+1]
    # AND for the loop to close, the [frames after LC+1] eventually lead back to [frames leading to LC].
    # This means the *entire sequence* must conceptually represent the loop.

    # Let's use the explicit wording:
    # "Re-arrange your latent history to form a "pre-looped" sequence: Create a new continuous sequence by taking the portion after the cut point (LC+1,...,LN) and placing it at the beginning, followed by the portion before the cut point (L1,...,LC)."
    # This implies the logical loop closure happens where LC meets LC+1 *after* the rearrangement.
    # Original: L1, L2, ..., LC, LC+1, ..., LN
    # Re-arranged: LC+1, ..., LN, L1, ..., LC
    # In this sequence, the *conceptual* loop point is between LC and LC+1,
    # which are now at the very end and very beginning of the re-arranged sequence.
    # The bridge should be inserted between the "new end" (LC) and the "new start" (LC+1).

    rearranged_latents = torch.cat((part_after_cut, part_before_cut), dim=0)
    # The transition from LC to LC+1 is now (rearranged_latents[-1] to rearranged_latents[0])

    # Convert list of tensors to a single tensor
    bridge_tensor = torch.stack(bridge_latents, dim=0)

    # 5. Insert Bridge into the Re-arranged History
    # The bridge goes between the 'new end' (LC) and the 'new start' (LC+1)
    # So, it's: [portion from LC+1 to LN], [BRIDGE], [portion from L1 to LC]
    # No, this is still not right.
    # The core idea is: The model processes a sequence. We want the "end" of the sequence
    # to flow smoothly into the "beginning" of the sequence, effectively forming a loop.

    # Let's simplify the construction for clarity.
    # We want a sequence: [Leading Frames] -> LC -> [BRIDGE] -> LC+1 -> [Trailing Frames]
    # where [Trailing Frames] eventually leads back to [Leading Frames] to close the loop.

    # Consider the input to the model to be a long, single sequence that *represents* the loop.
    # This sequence starts at some point, goes around, and ends at that same point (or just before).
    # If the original sequence is A-B-C-D-E, and we want to loop A to E.
    # The problem is E -> A.
    # You propose re-arranging (E, A, B, C, D) and then bridging D to E.
    # So the loop point is D -> [BRIDGE] -> E.
    # In the re-arranged sequence: LC+1, ..., LN, L1, ..., LC
    # The "seam" is between LC and LC+1.
    # So the bridge must be inserted after LC and before LC+1.
    # But in the re-arranged sequence, LC is at the *end* and LC+1 is at the *beginning*.

    # The most direct interpretation of "insert this Bridging_Latent sequence into your re-arranged history at the loop's join point"
    # means if your re-arranged sequence is S_R = (LC+1, ..., LN, L1, ..., LC),
    # the bridge is conceptually between S_R[-1] (which is LC) and S_R[0] (which is LC+1).
    # So the *new* full sequence for the model should be:
    # (LC+1,...,LN) + (L1,...,LC) + [BRIDGE from LC to LC+1]
    # No, this doesn't create a continuous sequence for the model.

    # Let's consider the resulting sequence that the model will process.
    # It must be a continuous temporal sequence that implicitly forms a loop.
    # If the original is L1...LC...LN.
    # The goal is that when the model generates LN, its context should lead it towards L1.
    # The proposed "pre-looped history" is the key.
    # It should look like: [Frames leading to LC], LC, [Bridge], LC+1, [Frames leading to LN], and then those LN frames lead to LC+1.

    # Let's use your example:
    # Original: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 (LN=L5)
    # Let cut_point_idx = 2 (so LC = L3, LC+1 = L4)
    # Original: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5
    # Re-arranged (Pre-looped History): L4, L5, L1, L2, L3
    # The seam is between L3 (new end) and L4 (new start).
    # So the bridge should conceptually go from L3 to L4.
    # The sequence the model sees: L4, L5, L1, L2, L3, [BRIDGE L3->L4]
    # And then what? The very end of this sequence is the bridge.
    # This means the *next* frame generated by the model would be L4, but through the bridge.

    # This implies the conceptual sequence for the model should be
    # [LC+1, ..., LN, L1, ..., LC, BRIDGE_L(C to C+1)]
    # And the model should then *continue* from BRIDGE_L(C to C+1) to generate LC+1.
    # This makes the sequence slightly longer and ensures the model is processing a "full loop" + bridge.

    # Let's build the sequence that represents the *entire loop with the bridge internally*.
    # If initial_latents = [L1, ..., LC, LC+1, ..., LN]
    # We want the loop to transition from LN back to L1, but through a conceptual bridge
    # from LC to LC+1 that's embedded.
    # The most direct interpretation for the model's *input* sequence:
    # (L1, ..., LC) + [BRIDGE from LC to LC+1] + (LC+1, ..., LN)
    # And then, when the model completes LN, its internal temporal context,
    # now trained on this looped sequence, should naturally lead back to L1.

    # Let's follow your rearrangement directly, as it defines the 'loop' for the model:
    # "Re-arranged (Pre-looped History): LC+1,...,LN,L1,...,LC"
    # This means the last frame is LC, and the first frame is LC+1.
    # The *logical* jump is from LC to LC+1. So the bridge must go between these two.

    # Let's define the parts of the original sequence:
    seq_A = initial_latents[:cut_point_idx+1]  # L1 ... LC
    seq_B = initial_latents[cut_point_idx+1:] # LC+1 ... LN

    # The re-arranged sequence (without bridge initially):
    # This is `part_after_cut` followed by `part_before_cut`
    rearranged_core = torch.cat((seq_B, seq_A), dim=0)

    # Now, the bridge needs to be inserted at the seam, which is effectively
    # after `seq_A` (LC) and before `seq_B` (LC+1).
    # But in `rearranged_core`, `seq_A` is at the end, and `seq_B` is at the beginning.
    # So, the conceptual bridge is between rearranged_core[-1] (LC) and rearranged_core[0] (LC+1).

    # To create a single continuous sequence for the model to refine,
    # we should insert the bridge *into* the original sequence at the cut point,
    # and then apply the re-arrangement to this augmented sequence.
    # No, that defeats the purpose of "pre-looped history."

    # The most straightforward way to present this to the model as a continuous sequence:
    # The sequence for the model should be:
    # `seq_A` (L1...LC)
    # THEN `bridge_tensor` (L_bridge_1...L_bridge_N)
    # THEN `seq_B` (LC+1...LN)
    # This sequence itself is not circular. It's a linear sequence with an added bridge.
    # The *final* step is the "Refinement Pass" where this entire sequence is fed.
    # For a *true loop*, the final frames must flow into the initial frames.

    # Ah, the paper's "FramePack" implicitly suggests processing segments.
    # The "pre-looped history" is for the model's *temporal_context*.
    # This means the model processes frames sequentially.
    # When it's at frame `i`, its `temporal_context` includes `i-k` to `i-1`.
    # If we feed it the sequence `LC+1,...,LN,L1,...,LC`, and then it processes the bridge,
    # and then it processes LC+1, etc.
    # This means the "loop's join point" is *within* the sequence you feed.

    # Let's consider the full sequence you would feed to the model during refinement.
    # It should be the entire loop length.
    # Original length = N.
    # New length = N + bridge_length.
    # The conceptual sequence: L1, ..., LC, [BRIDGE], LC+1, ..., LN.
    # But this still means LN needs to loop back to L1.

    # The core idea in "Pre-looped History" is to make the model *believe* it's looping.
    # This means the *training/refinement data* should reflect the loop.

    # Let's assume the model generates a sequence of length T.
    # We generate T frames: X1, X2, ..., XT.
    # We pick LC.
    # The final goal: loop from XT back to X1.
    # Your method is to make the model *generate* the transition from XT to X1 naturally.

    # The most direct interpretation of "re-arrange your latent history to form a 'pre-looped' sequence":
    # If the model is generating frames, and its context window slides:
    # At frame `k`, it uses `k-W ... k-1` as context.
    # When generating the *actual loop*, the frames are `L1...LN`.
    # To make LN lead to L1 smoothly:
    # We generate `L1...LN`.
    # Then we use a *modified context* for the final frames, or for a refinement pass.

    # Let's assume the refinement pass is on the *entire* generated sequence.
    # The sequence for refinement: `L1, ..., LC, [BRIDGE], LC+1, ..., LN`.
    # This means the bridge is *inserted* into the original linear sequence.
    # And then, the model is refined on this new, augmented sequence.
    # The expectation is that because the model saw a smooth transition from LC->LC+1 *via the bridge*,
    # when it gets to LN and the *next* frame is L1, it will inherently understand the loop.

    # Let's refine the sequence construction for the refinement pass.
    # The key is where the model sees the "seam."
    # If your "re-arranged history" is `S_R = (LC+1, ..., LN, L1, ..., LC)`,
    # then the *conceptual transition* is from `S_R[-1]` (LC) to `S_R[0]` (LC+1).
    # So the *actual sequence fed to the model for refinement* would be:
    # `S_R[0]`, `S_R[1]`, ..., `S_R[-1]` (which is LC), then `BRIDGE_L(C to C+1)`, then `S_R[0]` again (LC+1).
    # This is problematic, as `S_R[0]` is already `LC+1`.

    # Let's use the simplest, most intuitive approach for the refinement input:
    # The sequence is `L1, ..., LN`. The goal is to make `LN` transition smoothly to `L1`.
    # We need to create a `refinement_sequence` that guides this.
    # This `refinement_sequence` should be a full loop.

    # Let's define `Lc_latent` and `Lc_plus_1_latent` based on original `initial_latents`.
    lc_latent_original = initial_latents[cut_point_idx]
    lc_plus_1_latent_original = initial_latents[cut_point_idx + 1]

    # Generate bridge between Lc_latent_original and Lc_plus_1_latent_original
    bridge_latents = []
    # alpha_i should range such that it covers the transition.
    # If we have `bridge_length` frames, we want `bridge_length + 2` conceptual points
    # (LC, bridge_points..., LC+1).
    # Or, alpha_i goes from ~0 to ~1 over `bridge_length` steps.
    for i in range(bridge_length):
        alpha_i = (i + 1) / (bridge_length + 1) # Smoother alpha distribution, avoids 0 and 1
        interpolated_latent = torch.lerp(lc_latent_original, lc_plus_1_latent_original, alpha_i)
        noise = torch.randn_like(interpolated_latent) * noise_strength
        bridging_latent = interpolated_latent + noise
        bridge_latents.append(bridging_latent)
    bridge_tensor = torch.stack(bridge_latents, dim=0)

    # Now, construct the full sequence for refinement.
    # This sequence will conceptually represent the entire loop including the bridge.
    # L1, ..., LC, [BRIDGE from LC to LC+1], LC+1, ..., LN.
    # And then, the model must learn that LN connects to L1.
    # The most elegant way to handle this for a sliding window model is to
    # augment the original sequence with the bridge, and then for refinement,
    # circularly shift the *start* of the sequence for each batch/window
    # to ensure the loop point is seen in various contexts.

    # The actual sequence to be refined would be:
    # part_before_lc_plus_1 = initial_latents[:cut_point_idx + 1] # L1 ... LC
    # part_after_lc = initial_latents[cut_point_idx + 1:] # LC+1 ... LN

    # This seems like the most direct interpretation of "insert Bridge":
    full_augmented_sequence = torch.cat((
        initial_latents[:cut_point_idx + 1],  # L1 to LC
        bridge_tensor,                        # The bridge frames
        initial_latents[cut_point_idx + 1:]   # LC+1 to LN
    ), dim=0)

    # The length of this sequence is `initial_latents.shape[0] + bridge_length`.
    # Now, *this* is the sequence you would run the refinement pass over.
    # The model, when processing this, will see a smooth, denoisable transition
    # from `LC` to `LC+1` facilitated by `bridge_tensor`.
    # The *final step* to making it a loop is ensuring that the end of this
    # `full_augmented_sequence` (`LN`) flows smoothly back to its beginning (`L1`).
    # This is where the "Refinement Pass" needs to be structured.

    # If the model is *always* fed a fixed-size `temporal_context` window,
    # then during refinement, the `temporal_context` for frames near the end (`LN`)
    # should wrap around and include frames from the beginning (`L1`).
    # And similarly, for frames near the beginning (`L1`), the context should wrap
    # around and include frames from the end (`LN`).

    # This is the "Pre-looped History" in action for the *refinement itself*.
    # When you feed `full_augmented_sequence` to your model for refinement:
    # For a frame `f` in `full_augmented_sequence`, its `temporal_context` will be
    # `full_augmented_sequence[f-window_size : f-1]`.
    # To handle the looping for the refinement:
    # You would use `torch.roll` or careful indexing to create the *circular* `temporal_context`
    # for each frame in the `full_augmented_sequence`.

    # Example for creating a circular temporal context during refinement:
    # current_frame_idx = i
    # window_start_idx = (i - context_window_size + total_length) % total_length
    # window_end_idx = (i - 1 + total_length) % total_length
    # If window_start_idx > window_end_idx (e.g., wrap-around):
    #   context = torch.cat((full_augmented_sequence[window_start_idx:],
    #                        full_augmented_sequence[:window_end_idx + 1]), dim=0)
    # Else:
    #   context = full_augmented_sequence[window_start_idx : window_end_idx + 1]

    # This means the `full_augmented_sequence` is generated once.
    # Then, the refinement process (e.g., iterative denoising or an additional pass)
    # uses this sequence, but with *circular* context windows.

    # Let's adjust the return value to be the sequence to refine.
    return full_augmented_sequence

# Example Usage (conceptual, assuming HunyuanModel and refinement loop)
# from hunyuan_model import HunyuanModel # Replace with your actual model import
# model = HunyuanModel(...)
# initial_latents = model.generate_initial_sequence(prompt="a dog running", num_frames=30)
# cut_point = 15 # Example
# bridged_latents = create_seamless_loop_latents(initial_latents, cut_point)

# Now, during the refinement pass, you'd feed bridged_latents to the model,
# but critically, ensure the temporal context for the model is *circular*.
# This is where the 'pre-looped history' truly comes into play:
# it's not just about rearranging the input sequence, but about how the model *sees* time.

# Refinement loop (conceptual):
# refined_latents = bridged_latents.clone()
# for step in range(refinement_steps):
#     for i in range(refined_latents.shape[0]):
#         # Construct circular temporal context for frame 'i'
#         # This requires careful indexing/torch.roll on `refined_latents`
#         # to create a context that wraps around.
#         current_frame_latent = refined_latents[i]
#         context = get_circular_context(refined_latents, i, context_window_size)
#         
#         # Predict noise/denoise based on context and current latent
#         # new_latent = model.denoise(current_frame_latent, context, ...)
#         # refined_latents[i] = new_latent
#
#     # Optionally, add a small amount of noise again after a few steps
#     # to encourage further creative refinement, or for a "diffusion-like" pass.
#     # refined_latents += torch.randn_like(refined_latents) * small_refinement_noise
