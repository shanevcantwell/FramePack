Hi! You are continuing a python coding project that has burned through dozens of context windows so far, and will surely use up this one.Â 

Here find a dossier containing the current, complete state of all relevant files for this context window's subject. Please use this information as the single source of truth for our work today. Also find notes from the previous context about the state we left things in, which mostly functional except some weirdness around the LoRA UI.

Our collaboration is most effective when we follow our established principles. As my AI partner, please adhere to the following workflow:

{Rules:
* Ground Yourself in the information provided by me: Base all analysis and code generation strictly on the provided files and any error logs I share. Maintain things like variable and function names that already exist in the code

* Plan Before Coding: Before generating any code, first outline a concise, step-by-step plan for your proposed solution. I will approve or amend the plan before you proceed.

* Provide Granular Changes to Files: All code you generate should be self-contained and complete for the specific file it modifies. I will handle integrating it into the project.

* Obsequiousness/sycophancy: Apologies drive me nuts. Do not apologize to me. Just find a silver lining and move forward! ðŸ˜œ
}

I will provide the strategic direction and encourage appropriate times to move away from purely relying on inference to "first principles" logical, structured tactics, but appreciate your advice about best practices such as PEP8.

--- In our last episode...
Project: We are developing goan, a Gradio UI for a FramePack-style video generation model (HunyuanVideoTransformer3DModelPacked).



Background and Current State

The primary goal is to enable the use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to apply stylistic effects to video generations. Our investigation has revealed that a generic LoRA cannot be applied directly to our model due to a fundamental architectural mismatch.



The key findings are:

Model Incompatibility: The goan project uses a specific, memory-optimized model architecture internally known as HunyuanPacked (HunyuanVideoTransformer3DModelPacked). The LoRAs we have tested were *possibly* trained against different model architecture(s) (e.g., the standard Hunyuan image model, FLUX.1, or SDXL).

Manifestation of Mismatch: This incompatibility appears in two ways:

Layer Naming: The names of the weight-bearing layers inside the LoRA files (e.g., diffusion_model.double_stream_blocks...) do not match the layer names within our HunyuanPacked model (e.g., transformer_blocks...).

Layer Structure: Some LoRAs have a different internal structure entirely, such as fusing the Query, Key, and Value projections into a single layer, whereas our model keeps them separate.

Our current LoRAManager can only patch layers that have matching names and compatible structures. Therefore, a direct application of existing, off-the-shelf LoRAs is not feasible.



Plan: Options for LoRA Integration

Given that the project is focused on deep, hands-on learning with ML concepts, we have three potential paths forward.



Option 1: Train a Native HunyuanPacked LoRA

This is the most direct and stable approach. We would set up a training environment to fine-tune a new LoRA from scratch, using our exact HunyuanVideoTransformer3DModelPacked as the base model.



Pros: Guarantees perfect compatibility. The resulting LoRA will "just work" with our existing code.

Cons: Requires the effort of setting up and running a training pipeline.

Option 2: Develop an Offline LoRA Conversion Script

This is a practical middle ground for adapting existing LoRAs that are architecturally similar (e.g., standard Hunyuan LoRAs). We would write a one-time script that loads an incompatible LoRA, programmatically renames its internal weight keys to match the HunyuanPacked naming scheme, and saves a new, converted .safetensors file.



Pros: Reuses existing, pre-trained LoRAs. Less computationally intensive than a full retraining.

Cons: The script would need to be written and debugged. It will not work for LoRAs with fundamentally different structures (like fused QKV layers).

Option 3: Implement LoRA "Distillation" (Advanced)

This is the most complex but most powerful option, treating the problem as a knowledge transfer task. We would use an incompatible model+LoRA as a "teacher" to generate stylized images, and then train a new, native HunyuanPacked LoRA (the "student") to mimic the style of the teacher's output.



Pros: Can transfer a style between completely different model architectures. It is a deep and valuable machine learning project in its own right.

Cons: Highest complexity by far. It is a full model-training project requiring significant GPU time and careful implementation of the training loop and loss functions.

Recommended Files for Next Context

To pursue any of these options, the following 10 files provide the most critical context for the model architecture, LoRA application logic, and the generation pipeline:



ui/lora.py (The current LoRA loading and patching manager)

diffusers_helper/models/hunyuan_video_packed.py (The core model architecture we need to target)

core/generation_core.py (The main worker that orchestrates generation)

ui/queue.py (Shows how the LoRAManager is invoked and parameters are passed)

ui/shared_state.py (Defines the mapping of parameters and UI component lists)

diffusers_helper/pipelines/k_diffusion_hunyuan.py (The sampler that uses the patched model)

diffusers_helper/k_diffusion/wrapper.py (The CFG-handling wrapper for the model)

diffusers_helper/hunyuan.py (Core VAE and prompt encoding functions for this model family)

ui/layout.py (Defines the UI components, relevant for any potential UI changes)

core/generation_utils.py (Helper functions used by the generation core)

--- Experiments and research:
We spent a lot of time implementing LoRA support both in workflow and actually trying to wire directly to the diffusion model. However, cranking up the Real CFG and LoRA weight arbitrarily high (5.0 and 1.5) displayed no apparent change in the output.
